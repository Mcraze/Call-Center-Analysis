# Call Center Analysis

### Problem Statement:
As Call Center Manager at PhoneNow, I seek transparent insights into our call center's data. I need a concise dashboard highlighting long-term trends in customer and agent behavior, including metrics such as total calls answered and abandoned, speed of answer, call duration, and customer satisfaction. This dashboard will empower data-driven discussions with management, driving improvements in customer service and agent efficiency for our team.

### Questions to be Addressed:
- How many calls were answered during the three-month period of January to March 2021?
- What is the total number of abandoned calls, and how does it compare to the total calls answered?
- How does the average speed of answer vary over the specified time period?
- What is the average call duration, and how does it impact customer satisfaction and agent performance?
- What is the overall customer satisfaction rating for the call center, and how does it change over time?
- Are there any trends or patterns in customer behavior and call center metrics during the three-month period?
- Which agents consistently perform exceptionally well in terms of issue resolution, and who handles the highest percentage of calls received?
- Are there any notable correlations between call duration, customer satisfaction, and agent performance?
